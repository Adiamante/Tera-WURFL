This directory contains some unit tests for Tera-WURFL.

To run the tests;

* Copy ../TeraWurflConfig.php.example to ../TeraWurflConfig.php

* edit ../TeraWurflConfig.php so that it points to a test database in 
  your development environment.

  WARNING: This database may be trashed as part of the tests, so do 
           not use your production database.

* Run individual tests like this; "php unit/dummy_test.php"

* If you have ruby and rake installed on your development machine,
  you can run all the tests by typing "rake" while in this test
  directory. All tests will run, and you will see a summary message
  at the end, indicating whether or not there were any failures.
